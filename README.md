## Tweakpane Feature Testing

To run locally:
> Install npm and node: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/

> After downloading, run ```npm install``` to install packages.
> Then run ```npm run dev``` to launch the web app.

Currently, I'm testing different features of Tweakpane that affect visibility, namely the "hidden" and "disabled" properties. ([More info on these features](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/misc.html#tips))
